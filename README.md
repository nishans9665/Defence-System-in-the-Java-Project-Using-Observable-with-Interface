# Defense System – Java OOP Project (Observer Pattern)

A complete defense-unit simulation system developed using **Java** and **NetBeans IDE**.  
This project demonstrates communication between multiple defense units (Helicopter, Tank, Submarine) and a Main Control Unit using the **Observer Design Pattern**. Each unit has its own GUI and behavior, creating a fully interactive simulation.

## 🚀 Project Features

### 🛰️ Main Control Unit
- Central monitoring and control panel  
- Broadcast messages to all units  
- Send private messages to an individual unit  
- Collect information from all defense units  
- Updates system-wide strength  
- Handles area-clear status and message communication  

---

### 🚁 Helicopter Unit
- GUI for aerial operations  
- Shoot, missile, and laser actions  
- Position control  
- Sends strength and status updates to Main Controller  
- Receives and displays messages  

---

### 🚜 Tank Unit
- Ground combat operations  
- Shoot, missile, radar, and rotate-shoot controls  
- Soldier and ammo counters  
- Sends area and strength information  
- Displays messages from Main Controller  

---

### 🚢 Submarine Unit
- Underwater operations  
- Torpedo/missile firing, sonar activation  
- Custom underwater actions  
- Sends strength, status, and message updates  
- Receives broadcast and private messages

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Java  
- NetBeans IDE  
- Java Swing GUI  
- Observer Design Pattern  
- Interfaces & Inheritance  
- Enums (Strength levels)

## 📁 How the System Works
1. The system starts by creating all defense units and the Main Controller.  
2. Each unit registers itself as an observable to the controller.  
3. User actions (shoot, update sliders, send messages, etc.) trigger updates.  
4. The Main Controller receives updates and broadcasts messages or strength signals back.  
5. All units update their GUI in real time based on controller communication.

## 🖼️ User Interface
The project includes fully styled JFrame windows with background images for:
- Main Control Unit  
- Helicopter  
- Tank  
- Submarine  

Each window displays live message updates and operational actions.
